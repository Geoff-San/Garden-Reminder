# Garden-Reminder
Alpha, bare-bones project at this time.

Once complete, will send reminders to water your garden based on weather reports at a specified location.
  - More features may be added with author discretion.

Currently:
  - Retrieves the full sum of precipitation for a specified date range via "open-meteo" api.
  - Can send an email, notifying whether the garden needs to be watered, based on if it had rained enough recently.

Planned:
  - Automate setting the datetime based on system settings
      - Edit start/end dates to be the previous two days
  - Automate running the script every morning
      - May need to be done via OS settings instead
  - UI and ease of use edits
  - Configurable and toggleable settings.
  - Clean up and organize code.
